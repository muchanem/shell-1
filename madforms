I enjoy long, {adj1} walks on the beach, getting {edverb1} in the rain
and random encounters with {plural1}. I really like {breakfast_cereal}
mixed with {liquid}, and romantic, candle-lit {plural2}. I am well-read
from Dr. Seuss to {famous_person}. I travel frequently, especially
to {place}, when I am not busy with work. (I am a {occupation}.) I
am looking for {noun1} and beauty in the form of a {nationality}
goddess. She should have the physique of {male_celebrity} and the {noun2}
of {female_friend}. I would prefer if she knew how fix my {plural3}. I
know Iâ€™m not very attractive in my picture, but it was taken {number}
days ago, and I have since become more {adj2}.
